Assumptions:
    > Assumed I don't need separate pages for each section, all of it is in one page
        - Made my own interpretations about level of expertise
    
    > For q2, just printed type of event and object, made my own "names
    for object as nothing specifically mentioned. Example, all heading tags return 'heading', strong is returned, etc

    > Not entirely sure what group by meant but I have tokenised it and returned the counts as required.
    
    > Added a warning for less than 10000 words as I wasn't entirely sure what sir meant by text box with more than 10000 words.
